
Well, as it hase been sad in the course "A good instructor is always prepared",
i would prepare a PowerPoint presentation for our track which is intro to coding 
with python, the presentation will consist of the basics of python and what we will
learn at the end of the course and ofc there will be some Breaking the ice 
activities to get to know the students and thier personalitys.
Then i would  devide the students to groups that consist of 4-5 students based on thier skills
because group work is mandatory to follow during the workshops i would not exceed
less than 3 students to each group because larger groups decrease opportunities for 
participation and some members may become passive observer.
besides that i would assign in each group diffrent roles for diffrent students, so each group will
be balanced.
We will also discuss the estimated time to finch each task so we all be on the same
page and that would help us to avoid any barriers.
There for if we finshed on time it would be good but waht  is better that we even finsh earlier
so that means we have free time for additional tasks, activities, simple projects ... etc.
